****Contact Page******
Keeping this seperate from create customer
- Customer is created once
- contacts will need to be added, deleted over time

****Using the URL to pass the customer ID from customer_manage as I dont see any other way to
get the ID from a record in a table. Not passing the customer name using session as I think if 
someone were to change the id=2 number in the URL the customer name would not update.
