- When I edit a customer I dont get the drop down for county
- Wire up the job section
- All output is sanitized
- contact edit cant delete or update just one at a time
- change redirect from admin pages to have a time delay
- If I put an id that does not exist in the URL of Admin pages it breaks the pages
